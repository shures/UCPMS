## Usage


### Basic Usage

After downloading, simply edit the code inside src in your favorite text editor to make changes. These are the only files you need to worry about, you can ignore everything else!

### Advanced Usage

After installation, run `npm start` or `yarn start` which will start your application in the default port `3000 or 3001`. Open up a preview of the nepali datepicker in your default browser using (`localhost:port`), watch for changes to files inside, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `package.json` to see which tasks are included with the dev environment.

- `defaultDate` is a string or boolean. By default the date will be set as undefined. If you provide `defaultDate={true}`, then you get today date as default date. And, you can provide any custom date as default selected. `Eg: <NepaliDatePicker defaultDate="2076-11-10" />` sets date to  `2076-11-10`.
- `disabled` is a boolean. `true` disabled the datepicker select. By default the value is `false`.
- `onDateSelect` is a callback function, executes on date change and returns the date.
- `showResetDateButton` - is a boolean. `true` shows the reset button along with datepicker and on click to button it resets the date to initial state. By default the value is `false`.
